- **Type: Insecure Password Reset Token Generation (Predictable Token)**  
- **Severity: High**  
- **Impact: Password reset for users**   


The application uses predictable algorithm to generate restore tokens for the password reset functionality  

Inside login page there is a button to restore lost password that goes under **/modules/restore.php**.  

![restorepag](../images/restore_page.jpg)  

# Poc 
After submiting login to restore password, it redirects back to home page but, in http histore of Burp suite we can see that it made POST request with login=USER.  
![post](../images/post.png)  

To note, it is also possible to enumirate users, because after passing a non-existent user, the application responds with a non-existent user error.  
> {"error":true,"msg":"user not found"}  


In response we get JSON with link to reset password.  
>/restore.php?restore_token=YjQyMGMxZDMxZTY5YTgyM2ZiYzMwYTQzNDkwN2M5YzAxNzUyNzM4MzE1MTM5MzYwNjM3NA==


Given token is encoded in base64 which gives.  
> b420c1d31e69a823fbc30a434907c9c017527383151393606374


Which is actually md5 hash where b420c1d31e69a823fbc30a434907c9c0 is md5 and rest is timestamp with some data.

Having the correct token we can change the password by sending another **POST** request to **restore.php**. 
![pass](../images/pass.png)  


However, its not that easy to change admin password, when we send a request with the admin login to change password, we are not getting direct link, instead its response with  
> {"error":false,"msg":"link created"}

This partial mitigation is insufficient, as it relies on obscurity â€” not cryptographic security.  
The token format can be brute-forced, which can lead to access to admin functionality.
